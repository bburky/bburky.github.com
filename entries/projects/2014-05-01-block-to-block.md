An HTML5 sliding block puzzle game

Originally written framework-less using the [JavaScript Canvas 2D API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) directly. Rewritten in late 2017 to learn the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) game framework.

The original version supported both keyboard and multitouch input. The Phaser rewrite only supports keyboard input.
