An [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) custom component to receive IR codes with [`remote_receiver`](https://esphome.io/components/remote_receiver.html) and convert them into BLE HID keystrokes. Uses a `Esp32BLEKeyboard` custom component and the [ESP32 BLE Keyboard library](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard).
