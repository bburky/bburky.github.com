Simple webapp for [Smart Chef](https://smartchef.me/) kitchen scale to display the value via [Web Bluetooth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API). Installable as a PWA, but offline support isn't quite finished. [Protocol decoding implementaion](https://github.com/bburky/smartchef-web-bluetooth/blob/main/script.js#L257) on personal reverse engineering and publicly available documents for other scales.

Developed a while back on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) (before it died), now moved over to GitHub and published on GitHub Pages.
